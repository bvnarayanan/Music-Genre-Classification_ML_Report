# Music-Genre-Classification_ML_Report
We developed a multi-class classification model to determine the genre of novel songs using a database of approximately 18,000 songs described by 15 numerical features. Our approach involved using a Random Forest model and an SVM to compare their performance. The Random Forest classifier achieved an accuracy of around 54% in genre classification, while the Support Vector Machine achieved an accuracy of approximately 56%. Although certain songs with ambiguous characteristics posed challenges, our model outperformed random chance and highlighted the importance of more high-dimensional data for accurate music genre classification.
